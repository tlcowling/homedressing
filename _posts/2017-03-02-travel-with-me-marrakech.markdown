This trip was for my birthday in the end of February with 5 of my girlfriends.
4 days, 3 nights, 6 bottles of prosecco.
Accommodation
Riad Losra in Medina of Marrakesh. I was inviting girls to the trip and providing accommodation. This Riad had great reviews, mainly because of comfort level and beyond great hospitality. Price 65 Eur per person for three nights. It is on the other side from the main square, which I consider a plus and the morning call for prayers is not so loudly heard there.
 
Our flight was at 12:50, so we came to the airport around 11 AM to annoy some people in the business lounge, have some chicken and gin&tonic. 
 
Upon arrival, first thing we did was a food tour, which I found on Airbnb. This seemed like a perfect introduction to the city. Walking through the souks or main square alone for the first time could have been overwhelming. With the guide we felt protected, but had plenty of space to explore the city for ourselves. We tried variety of food, including roasted in underground ovens lamb, snails (that tasted kinda like a bottom of the river) and local fast food, made of a cow spline (recommended!). Getting home was fun, I asked the guide to point us in a right direction towards Riad and I am sure we will find it. Actually, it was not very difficult, as our riad was near Medina entrance, so logically, if you just go around Medina in the same direction, you will eventually find it. His explanation seemed to me something like this: where the bird sits turn to the right, and where cars park keep left, then you will see a whole in the road, that means your street is on the right. We got lost only once and I blame navigation system for that (which was set to car mode).We got home tired and inspired. 
 
Next morning we woke up for our first Moroccan breakfast and made it even better with some mimosas. In three days I had 5 breakfasts, so I can say, that local breakfast should include some bread and stuff to dip bread in, like honey, argan oil, peanut mix (similar to peanut butter, but liquid), I really think, that everything else, they add just for tourists. 
We had a tour to Agafay desert booked (again chosen via Airbnb). Rachid picked us up at the hotel, we picked up two other travellers form Italy and the journey began. I was very hesitant about the tour, as there are so much of them and they all seem alike. It was a great experience. Besides coming to argan oil production cooperative (which might be a tourist trap, but who cares), hiking around Imlil villages, having lunch with a stunning view and riding camels (and even best, meeting a four day and an eight day old camel), we got to know the differences between Berber and Arab culture, some history, traditions and modern ways of living in Imlil villages.  
 
In the evening we went out for a drink, I definitely recommend to do some research beforehand. A lot of restaurants do not serve alcohol. We did not want to get lost and waste time, so we ended up in a quite overpriced restaurant with a roof top terrace, but no local feel what so ever. 
 
Next morning I went on a hot air balloon experience. I was picked up at 6AM, brought outside the city, got some coffee, put on the air balloon, shown the most stunning sunrise and was fed some more breakfast. Needless to say, that was a one of a kind experience and my phone is overloaded with photos and videos. I would describe it as peaceful, stunning and intoxicating. 
 
Upon arrival at half before 12, my breakfast at the Riad was still waiting for me. Girls went shopping, while I was gone, they found some leather bags and stocked on some Moroccan tea. Riad hosts presented me a delicious cake and I teared up over blowing the candles (did I mention it was my birthday?).
 
Next up was some shopping and exploring on the way to hammam. We went to Herritage spa for hammam. I got extra foot massage and most of the girls went for a full body massage. Most of us were satisfied and relaxed, but in case you are on a budget and not afraid, I recommend to go to a public hammam. We were poured constant tea and hammam provides everything you need, they would even wash your hair, if you want, and depending on attending wash your privates, whether you want or you don't. Because of the limited space, the whole thing felt conveyory to me.
 
After dressing up in the hotel, girls took me to a lovely restaurant. Where we had an aperitif on the roof top terrace and a degustation of (what felt like) twenty course menu in the atrium under orange trees. Something to take note of: our Riad host contacted the restaurant and they sent a person to pick us up and lead to the restaurant. It was a five minute walk through the labyrinth of Medina. After the dinner, they took us back home, which might be to protect the city from our laughter and drunken happiness. 
 
The last morning we spent meeting sunrise from the roof top terrace of our Riad. After we went to visit famous Majorelle garden, which is very photogenic and magical, with light making its way through the trees and cactuses in the morning. Get there early, before everyone else does!
 
After the last delicious and full breakfast in Riad we had some time left for shopping and wondering through the city. Me and one of my friends got "lost" from the rest and went to find a quite a roof top terrace restaurant, with a stunning view of a mosque and Atlas mountains.
 
I want to mention, that on the last day, we were almost navigating Medina like locals, also traveling with just girls, we didn't have any unpleasant experience what so ever. May be we stayed further from the main square or we scare everyone with our hard laughs and post-mimosas happiness. What is a big bonus, you do not feel, like a walking wallet, some sellers don't even bother to serve you in the shop, not mentioning luring you in. After reading lots of blogs and warnings about how Marrakesh is too much in every sense, I was pleasantly surprised of the atmosphere and I find it just enough.
 
What I would love to do and see next time in Marrakesh: 
- paragliding over the Agafay desert 
- visiting Dab Debbagh, where they make animal skin leather (too graphic?)
- see some more of the main square 
- visit Secret garden
- go hiking outside Marrakesh
- go to a local hammam
